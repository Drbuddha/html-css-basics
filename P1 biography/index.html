                    Father of the Nepal

                    <b>Prithvi Narayan Shah</b> was born prematurely on 7 January 1723 as the first child of Nara Bhupal
                    Shah
                    and
                    Kaushalyavati Devi in the Gorkha Palace.
                    Idols of PrithviNarayan Shah with his two wives
                    Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah's education began at age five through the appropriate
                    ceremony.[clarification needed] At that time, the responsibility to educate him was given to
                    Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal. They were the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace as
                    astrologers,
                    where they were also known as Jyotishi or Jaisi[citation needed]. Even though the Gurus provided his
                    primary education, the duty of developing his character was taken on by Queen Chandra
                    Pravawati[citation
                    needed]. It is said that seeing the princes of neighboring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski
                    indulge in
                    excess pleasure, Chandra Pravawati kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from pleasurable or wrong
                    pursuits.
                    That is why no traces of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life.
                    [verification needed] Narbhupal Shah wanted P.N. Shah to marry a strong family so that it would
                    assist
                    him if needed. The best prospect of marriage that he saw fit was with the Kingdom of Makwanpur. P.N.
                    Shah had turned 14 in 1737 C.E. and it was decided that he would marry Indrakumari, the daughter of
                    Hemkarna Sen, the Princess of Makwanpur in the Pre-Unification Nepal. <b>&copy; text copy From
